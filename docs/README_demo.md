Demo HTML

This folder holds the demo HTML exported by the simulation. To publish via GitHub Pages:

1. Add or update the `docs/demo_sim.html` file.
2. Commit and push the `docs/` folder.
3. In GitHub repository Settings -> Pages, select `main` branch and `/docs` folder as the source.

The `index.html` in `docs/` is a small wrapper that embeds the exported demo HTML.
